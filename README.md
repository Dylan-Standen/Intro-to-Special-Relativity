# Special Relativity: A (Very) Brief Introduction

This short expository note was written to introduce the essential structures of **special relativity** to a friend studying Chemistry (Part II Natural Sciences, University of Cambridge), with an eye toward applications in **quantum field theory**. 

It gives a concise but mathematically grounded overview of:
- Minkowski space and the Lorentz metric
- Tangent and cotangent bundles
- The Lorentz group and its Lie algebra
- Representations of SO(1,3)
- Relativistic dynamics and the energy–momentum tensor
- Maxwell theory and Lorentz covariance

The text aims to balance **physical intuition** with **mathematical structure**, serving as a bridge between undergraduate relativity and the formulation of quantum field theory.

> “These are essentially all the tools you need to jump straight into QFT.”

### Context

Written in 2025 after completing Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. So, it is written to the level expected for someone about to undertake a QFT course at Cambridge. It is mainly intended as an accessible resource for students encountering relativity from a non-physics background.  

The document is pedagogical rather than research-oriented, but it reflects my broad interest in **mathematical physics**, **geometric formulations of QFT**, and **clear exposition**.
