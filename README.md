# Special Relativity: A (Very) Brief Introduction

This short expository note was written to introduce the essential structures of **special relativity** to a friend studying Chemistry (Part II Natural Sciences, University of Cambridge), with an eye toward applications in **quantum field theory**.

It gives a concise but mathematically grounded overview of:

- Minkowski space and the Lorentzian metric
- Tangent and cotangent bundles
- The Lorentz group and its Lie algebra
- Finite-dimensional representations of $SO^+(1,3)$
- Relativistic dynamics and the energy–momentum tensor
- Maxwell theory in covariant form and gauge symmetry

The text aims to balance **physical intuition** with **mathematical structure**. It is written at the level of an advanced undergraduate who has completed Part II of the Mathematical Tripos or Part II Natural Sciences (or an equivalent programme), and assumes some familiarity with linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and basic Lie algebras.

By the end of these notes, the reader should be well-prepared to tackle, for example, the “Special Relativity” example sheet for Cambridge Part III General Relativity ([link](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/files/misc/grspecialrelativity.pdf)).

### Context

The notes were written in 2025 after I completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. They are pitched at roughly the level expected for someone about to undertake a first course in quantum field theory at Cambridge.

The document is pedagogical rather than research-oriented, and is mainly intended as an accessible resource for students encountering relativity from a non-physics background. It reflects my broader interest in **mathematical physics**, **geometric formulations of QFT**, and **clear exposition**.
